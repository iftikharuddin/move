## let's start with move security blogs (OtterSec)

- an auditor's introduction: https://github.com/0xriazaka/Move-Audit-Resources?tab=readme-ov-file
    - **summary of this article**: **Move** is a blockchain programming language designed for safer smart contracts. It uses **strong typing** to prevent you from accidentally mixing up different types of tokens/coins (like preventing Bitcoin code from being used with Ethereum), and **formal verification** to mathematically prove your code works correctly. Think of it as "training wheels for blockchain programming" - it catches dangerous mistakes before they happen, but isn't a magic solution to all security problems.
 
- move prover : https://osec.io/blog/2022-09-16-move-prover
    - **summary of this article**: The **Move Prover** is a tool that mathematically proves your blockchain code works correctly by checking your written specifications (rules like "this function never crashes" or "result equals a + b") against **all possible inputs**, not just test cases. You write simple rules in English-like statements, and it uses automated theorem proving to verify your code follows those rules universally. It's particularly useful for proving economic invariants (like "users can't drain funds") and safety properties that traditional testing might miss.
